1. What is a List?

--A list is a built-in ordered, mutable (changeable), indexable collection in Python
--It can hold multiple items (elements) in a single variable.
--Lists can store different data types: integers, floats, strings, booleans, even other lists (nested lists).
--Defined using square brackets []
-- also create by list constructor ex list()
-- example:
  my_list = [10, "hello", 3.14, True]
print(my_list)   # [10, 'hello', 3.14, True]


2. Characteristics of Lists
--Characteristics of Lists

1.Ordered → items have a fixed sequence.

2.Indexable → access items by index (0-based).

3.Mutable → you can add, remove, change elements.

4.Heterogeneous → allows mixed data types.

5.Dynamic → size can increase or decrease.
